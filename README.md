# Face Cropper

日本語の説明：https://github.com/rtorii/Face-Cropper-Description/tree/main

Code: https://github.com/GhaithKhoja/ARG_Project

**Description**

This web app aims to simplify and accelerate the process of cropping human heads/faces from images. The input would be a normal image and the output would be the cropped head with a transparent background. The backbone of the project would be using the Mask R-CNN imported from PyTorch library ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870 ) to detect faces and fine tune under dataset such as Face/Head Segmentation Dataset Community Edition.

**Targeted Audience**

This app targets individuals and groups who want to crop heads from images in an easy and timely manner. The main target user audience is artists and designers who want to use cropped images to create new products. This can include a person who wants to paste a cropped head image on another image or someone who wants to create stickers with these cropped images.  

Instead of going to photoshop and manually cropping the head portion, which can be a tedious process, the user can easily upload the image to the website, and an image of the cropped image will be generated in seconds for the user to download. Users can start their own businesses to create products. Since this may require users to use our app repeatedly to get cropped images to be used for new designs of their products, it is important for them to use an app, like ours, which completes the task of cropping heads in an efficient manner.
